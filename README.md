# printf

## Description
`printf` is a function in the C programming language that allows you to print formatted output to the standard output stream (usually the console). It is part of the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and is widely used for displaying information to the user.

## Syntax
The syntax for `printf` is as follows:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int printf(const char *format, ...);
```

The `printf` function takes a format string as its first argument, followed by additional arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in the format string. The format string contains regular characters that are printed as-is, along with format specifiers that define the type and formatting of the additional arguments.

## Format Specifiers
Format specifiers in the format string begin with the '%' symbol, followed by a character that specifies the type of the argument. Some commonly used format specifiers include:

- `%d` - for printing integers.
- `%f` - for printing floating-point numbers.
- `%c` - for printing characters.
- `%s` - for printing strings.
- `%p` - for printing pointers.

There are many more format specifiers available, allowing you to format and print various types of data.

## Examples
Here are a few examples to illustrate the usage of `printf`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 1.75;
    char grade = 'A';
    char name[] = "John";

    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Height: %.2f meters\n", height);
    printf("Grade: %c\n", grade);
    printf("Name: %s\n", name);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Age: 25
Height: 1.75 meters
Grade: A
Name: John
```

## Return Value
The `printf` function returns the number of characters successfully printed (excluding the null character at the end). If an error occurs during printing, a negative value is returned.

## Important Points
- The format string can contain a combination of regular characters and format specifiers.
- Format specifiers are replaced by the corresponding arguments in the order they appear.
- Make sure the number and type of arguments match the format specifiers to avoid undefined behavior or runtime errors.
- Format specifiers provide options for formatting the output, such as width, precision, and alignment. Refer to the C documentation for more details.

# C Library Functions

## man 2 write

### Description
The `write` function is a system call in the C programming language that writes data from a buffer to a specified file descriptor. It is typically used for low-level I/O operations. The function takes three arguments: the file descriptor, a pointer to the buffer containing the data to be written, and the number of bytes to write.

### Syntax
```c
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```

The `write` function returns the number of bytes written if successful, and -1 if an error occurs.

## man 3 malloc

### Description
The `malloc` function is used to dynamically allocate memory in the C programming language. It allows you to request a specific amount of memory from the operating system's heap at runtime. The allocated memory can be used to store data and is released using the `free` function.

### Syntax
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void *malloc(size_t size);
```

The `malloc` function takes the size in bytes as its argument and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. If the allocation fails, it returns `NULL`.

## man 3 free

### Description
The `free` function is used to deallocate dynamically allocated memory in the C programming language. It allows you to release memory that was previously allocated using `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`. When memory is freed, it becomes available for future allocations.

### Syntax
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void free(void *ptr);
```

The `free` function takes a pointer to the memory block to be deallocated. It doesn't return a value.

## man 3 va_start

### Description
The `va_start` macro is part of the C standard library's `<stdarg.h>` header. It is used to initialize a variable argument list declared using the `va_list` type. Variable argument lists allow functions to accept a variable number of arguments.

### Syntax
```c
#include <stdarg.h>

void va_start(va_list ap, last_arg);
```

The `va_start` macro initializes the `va_list` object `ap` for subsequent traversal. It takes two arguments: the `va_list` object to be initialized and the last named parameter before the variable arguments.

## man 3 va_end

### Description
The `va_end` macro is used to clean up a variable argument list after it has been processed. It should be called at the end of a function that uses a variable argument list, after all the arguments have been accessed.

### Syntax
```c
#include <stdarg.h>

void va_end(va_list ap);
```

The `va_end` macro takes the `va_list` object `ap` as its argument and performs the necessary cleanup.

## man 3 va_copy

### Description
The `va_copy` macro is used to make a copy of a `va_list` object. It allows you to create a duplicate of a variable argument list, which can be useful when you need to traverse the same arguments multiple times.

### Syntax
```c
#include <stdarg.h>

void va_copy(va_list dest, va_list src);
```

The `va_copy` macro takes two arguments: `dest`, which is the destination `va_list` object to be copied to, and `src`, the source `va_list` object from which the copy is made.

## man 3 va_arg

### Description
The `va_arg` macro is used to access the next argument in a variable argument list. It allows you to retrieve the values of the arguments passed to a function that accepts a variable number of arguments.

### Syntax
```c
#include <stdarg.h>

type va_arg(va_list ap, type);
```

The `va_arg` macro takes two arguments: the `va_list` object `ap` and the type of the next argument to be retrieved. The type should match the actual type of the argument.
